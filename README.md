An experiment in openness.

## Who am I?
I'm [@martindale](https://twitter.com/martindale), an [open-source software
developer][github], systems theorist, and [practicing cypherpunk][blockstream].
I call myself a **relentless maker**.

Even though privacy is one of my guiding principles, I like the idea of
transparency.  For example, some of my other projects include:

- [A generalized repository for self-improvement][self]
- [Putting my genome under version control][genome]

Openness helps prevent the duplication of effort, encourages a higher quality of
work, and gives others the opportunity to leverage the outcome in an additive
manner.

I'm excited to have a conversation with you, so **ask me anything!**
